1. Algorithm is finding the smallest and the largest element of the array and storing it in x and y respectively and returning the difference between them.

2. In the algorithm x and y stores the element at the 0th position of the array as the initial condition.
For n-2 iterations element stored in x is compared with the ith elements of the elements of the array. Hence x stores the smallest element.
Similarly element stored in y is compared with the elements of the array for n-2 iterations.The largest element is stored in y
for every comparisons made between the y and the ith position element of the array.

3. The basic operation executes n-1 times. It depends on the size of the array given as input by the user.

4. Suppose n=7 and
   A[7]=[10 12 1 5 15 6]
   then
   i    A[i]    x     y
   1     10     10    10
   2     12     10    12
   3      1      1    12
   4      5      1    12
   5     15      1    15
   6      6      1    15

5. Efficiency of the algorithm according to formula is: O(n)
